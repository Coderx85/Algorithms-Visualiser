**Algorithm Visualiser**
======================

A web-based application that showcases a variety of pathfinding algorithms and maze generation techniques.

**Algorithms**
-------------

Our application supports the following pathfinding algorithms:

* **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Weighted)**: The father of pathfinding algorithms, Dijkstra's Algorithm guarantees the shortest path by exploring nodes in a graph based on their distance from the starting node.
* **A\* (Weighted)**: A more efficient version of Dijkstra's Algorithm that uses heuristics to guide the search towards the goal node, guaranteeing the shortest path.
* **Greedy Best-first Search (Weighted)**: A faster and more heuristic-heavy version of A*, which does not guarantee the shortest path but provides a good approximation.
* **Breath-first Search**: A simple algorithm that explores nodes in a graph level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path.
* **Depth-first Search**: An algorithm that explores nodes recursively until it reaches a dead end or finds the goal node.

## Maze Generation

Our application also features a Recursive Division Maze Generation algorithm, which creates complex mazes with varying levels of difficulty.

## Tools Used

To build this project, we used:

* HTML5 for structuring content
* CSS3 for styling and layout
* JavaScript for implementing algorithm logic
* React for building reusable UI components

## How to Use

1. Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu or use the keyboard shortcuts (F1-F5) to switch between algorithms.
2. Adjust parameters such as grid size, grid density, and obstacle density using the sliders or text inputs.
3. Click "Start" to begin generating a maze or running an algorithm on your chosen settings.
4. Observe how each algorithm navigates through the maze or graph structure in real-time.

We hope you enjoy exploring this interactive visualisation tool!
